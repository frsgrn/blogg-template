Part of the[fifth generation of video game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_of_video_game_consoles \"Fifth generation of video game consoles\"), it was the successor to the successful[Sega Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis \"Sega Genesis\"). The Saturn has a dual-[CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing unit\")architecture and eight processors. Its games are in[CD-ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM \"CD-ROM\")format, and its game library contains several[ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting \"Porting\")of[arcade games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_games \"Arcade games\")as well as original games.\n\nDevelopment of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking[3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics \"3D computer graphics\")[Model 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Model_1 \"Sega Model 1\")arcade hardware debuted. The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company[Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi \"Hitachi\"). Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming[PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) \"PlayStation (console)\").\n\nThe Saturn was initially successful in Japan but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the[Nintendo 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64 \"Nintendo 64\")in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a[commercial failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_failures_in_video_games \"List of commercial failures in video games\"). The failure to release a game in the*[Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series) \"Sonic the Hedgehog (series)\")*series, known in development as*[Sonic X-treme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_X-treme \"Sonic X-treme\")*, has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.\n\nAlthough the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games, including*[Nights into Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams \"Nights into Dreams\")*, the*[Panzer Dragoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_Dragoon_(series) \"Panzer Dragoon (series)\")*series, and the*[Virtua Fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_(series) \"Virtua Fighter (series)\")*series, its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited[third-party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_developer \"Third-party developer\")support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system's development and discontinuation."
